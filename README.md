## Visit Cluj - A tour guide
### Because this app focuses on the fundamentals of multi-screen apps, it only has a basic UI.

This app shows some of the main attractions of Cluj-Napoca and acts as a Tour Guide.

In this app I learned how to:
- Select data structures to store lists of information
- Building layouts to display those lists of data
- Navigating between screens using a ViewPager with fragments
- Creating my own custom classes
